LogisticRegression is an R package that does some k-means segmentation as well as full logistic regression with several model diagnostics and helpful plots as outputs.
I wrote this to make viewing and assessing logistic regression results in R a bit less disparate.

Be sure to follow the console as some parts of the program are interactive. 
For example, when the function findk reaches its maximum, the next press of [Enter] will 
prompt the user to enter a desired number of clusters. 
Be sure to enter a number, anything else causes an error.

The example of use is the R script MainProgram.R
